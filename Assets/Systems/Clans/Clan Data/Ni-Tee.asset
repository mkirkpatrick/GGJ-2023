  description: "The Nih-tee are a clan of highly spiritual rhino beetles. The Nih-tee
    live monk-like, ascetic lives in worship of a rhinoceros deity, and spend their
    time meditating, philosophizing, honing their swordsmanship, and sharpening their
    horns.\r\n\r\nFor the Nih-tee, the Path is the ultimate spiritual pilgrimage.
    Their texts foretell of a Chosen One who will one day reach the end of the Path
    where awaits their deity, ready to crown the Nih-tee as the rightful stewards
    of his kingdom.\r"
