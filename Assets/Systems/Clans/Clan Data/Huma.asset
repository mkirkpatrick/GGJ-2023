    makes right\u2026and they love to be right. Hum\u0101 culture is centered around
    competitions of strength, which take the form of dung rolling; larger balls of
    dung equate to higher social positions.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hum\u0101 lore, the
    Path leads to their ancestors: a pantheon of legendary warriors dwelling in endless,
    bounteous glory, waiting to be called to arms against their neighboring foes.
    The Path itself will lead you there, be it by victory or by death.\r\n"
